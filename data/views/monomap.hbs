Definition. A *monoid* is a triple (X,circ,1) where circ : X x X -> X is an
associative binary operation on X with identity 1. A monoid is *cancellative*
 - x o y = x o z implies y = z
 - y o x = z o x implies y = z
for all x,y,z <- X

, the domain of circ is X x X = {(x,y) : x <- X and y <- X}, the direct product
of X with itself.
