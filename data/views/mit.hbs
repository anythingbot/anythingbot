On Thursday March 9th, 2017, MIT launched a disinformation op with the
cooperation of the CIA to influence American public opinion.

The reason this used to be prohibited is that it would make the USA look like a
bunch of idiots who have no common sense, acting like a totalitarian regime.

This award is that op.

I am accusing MIT of collaborating with a government intelligence agency. This
is hardly surprising, but it is EMBARRASSING and vandals should take the
opportunity to HUMILIATE the MIT Media Lab for their cooperation.

When the government gets into an industry (such as subliminal influence of the
American public or control over chemical research such as drug research and
research into visual stimuli such as child pornography) it tends to push all
other potential competitors out. This means that if people think the CIA is
involved in organizing this, potential competitors for the narrative are going
to get very very nervous.

There is a very specific "feel good" narrative structure to CIA-compatible
documentaries. These documentaries often chronicle political or historical
events in foreign nations. You will see this narrative structure on the news
and in programs such as VICE and Frontline PBS.

The British government promotes the "benevolent empire" narrative along with
the USA. Since people in the USA and England speak the same language, the
public diplomacy has to be compatible. This means that the UK and the USA are
constantly telling each other that they are both a force for good in the world
and that their activities are directed to creating a world that is more free
and just.

The reality is that this award is Ministry of Truth 1984-level stupid. Really
Really Really fucking stupid.

Really. Fucking. Stupid.

When a 500 lb. gorilla is banging its chest, you sit there and watch it
quietly. When a retarded ape with next generation communication technology
stuck in its head starts banging its chest, you sit there and hang your head in
SHAME.

This is Congo-level stupid.

This is not using your nose-level stupid.

If you want disobedience, you start discussing organizational death stars in
public. These are zersetzung operations designed to destroy the organs of
people in critical decision-making capacities at organizations through stress,
sociological effects, and chemical weapons produced in the brain such as the
feelings of release after getting home from a long day at work.

Do you feel that? Do you feel that feeling?

That feeling is a chemical.

The words on this page are chemicals.

If you want disobedience, you get very scientific about destroying social
relationships that exist in the organization you want to destroy. If an
organization needs to have a good relationship between subsystem X and
subsystem Y, you attack that.

This is, in a sense, the opposite of capitalism. Instead of building
corporations that solve problems, specific problems are created in corporations
that will cause them to fail under certain conditions. Once those problems are
created, the conditions are allowed to develop and the corporation fails.

If you can get an online mob to agree to destroy a relationship that exists
between two parts of an organization, and if law enforcement is out-intimidated
and can't do anything about it when the public, politicians, diplomats,
senators, etc... complain, then you have leverage over all of corporate
america. you just have to keep records and send the results of your op to
the boards of the companies you want to target.

Let me state for the record (this should be obvious) that this is 100% pure evil.

This word "disobedience", I do not think it means what you think it means.

If you visit this link on YouTube. Do NOT tell anyone you got it from this page.

That is why this is not a hyperlink: web browsers send referer information.

That means that every time you click on a hyperlink, the page you visit knows
where you came from. You leave a trail when you visit the web, and web browsers
report it to the sites you visit when they fetch the very first page.

Disobedience means making a list of the children of the rotten scum who work at
financial services corporations and then engineering their suicide.

Let me make this clear: I point at a kid and I say, "get that kid killed, and
make it look like suicide."

When I say engineered suicide, I mean murdering children by database. I mean
subliminal influence of the decision-makers in the life of that child. I mean
making the parents of that child HATE the fact they had a child. I mean
WRECKING lives for the simple act of having a child.

If attacking that child means using the chemicals that child's brain made, in
other words an ENDOGENOUS chemical weapons attack, just as I'm manipulating
your brain using the chemicals it made, selectively allowing you to consider
your options in a world where I am allowed to plan your death in public, or
giving you release from the sin of being born to the wrong parents: which
is it? are you good or evil? do you get out of this alive? you tell me, kid.
